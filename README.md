## 👋 Hi, I’m Roy
- 🏋️‍ I am into lifting heavy stuff and coding
- 📷 https://www.instagram.com/lockout.lotzwik/
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React-Native

In my free time I like to pick up small projects which I think are useful for me and others.
Currently in progress:
- https://github.com/Roy0815/payback-scanner  : Mobile app that will allow scanning receipts and messaging Payback automatically about missing points
- https://github.com/Roy0815/slack-openpl-bot : API for Slack that will integrate data from https://www.openpowerlifting.org/
