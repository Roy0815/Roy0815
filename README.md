## 👋 Hi, I’m Roy
- 🏋️‍ I am into lifting heavy stuff and coding
- 📷 [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lockout.lotzwik/)

In my free time I like to pick up small projects which I think are useful for me and others.
Currently in progress:
- [Slack Service Bot for our Non-Profit](https://github.com/Roy0815/slack-service-bot): An Application for Slack that helps our Non-Profit sports club with useful functions that save time and streamline workflows.
- [Slack Openpowerlifting Bot](https://github.com/Roy0815/slack-openpl-bot): API for Slack that will integrate data from https://www.openpowerlifting.org/
